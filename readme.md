# emonTH V2.0

**Low power wireless temperature and humidity node**

*V2.0 hardware revision adds support for SI7021 temperature and humidity. This sensor brings performance and power savings over the DHT22, see [sensor](sensor) folder of this repo for sensor evaluation and comparison.*

The emonTH V2 is an open-source, wireless, battery powered temperature and humidity monitoring node.

Data from the emonTH is transmitted via wireless RF (433MHz) to an emonPi / emonBase web-connected base-station for logging to Emoncms for data logging, processing and graphing.
